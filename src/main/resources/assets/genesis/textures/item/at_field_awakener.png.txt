This is a placeholder for the AT Field Awakener texture.

To complete this implementation:
1. Create a 16x16 PNG image named "at_field_awakener.png"
2. Replace this text file with the actual PNG
3. The image should be square, 16x1664 pixels
4. Suggested design: Glowing geometric pattern with AT Field theme

For now, the item will use Minecraft's default missing texture (purple/black checkerboard).
